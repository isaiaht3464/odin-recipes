    <p>Indian cuisine is definitely my weakness. Saying no to an Indian dish is just not something
        that I am capable of. This Chicken Tikka Masala recipe is sure to impress if you're cooking 
        for a crowd, and will offer a meal you'll come back to time and time again, even if you're 
        just cooking for one.

    <p><h2>Instructions</h2></p>
        <p><ol>
            <li><h3>Step 1</h3></li>
            <p>Combine garlic, ginger, turmeric, garam masala, coriander, 
            and cumin in a small bowl. Whisk yogurt, salt, and half of spice 
            mixture in a medium bowl; add chicken and turn to coat. Cover and 
            chill 4-6 hours. Cover and chill remaining spice mixture.</p>
            
            <li><h3>Step 2</h3></li>
            <p>Heat ghee in a large heavy pot over medium heat. Add onion, tomato paste, 
            cardamom, and chiles and cook, stirring often, until tomato paste has darkened 
            and onion is soft, about 5 minutes. Add remaining half of spice mixture and cook, 
            stirring often, until bottom of pot begins to brown, about 4 minutes.</p>
            
            <li><h3>Step 3</h3></li>
            <p>Add tomatoes with juices, crushing them with your hands as you add them. Bring to 
            a boil, reduce heat, and simmer, stirring often and scraping up browned bits from bottom 
            of pot, until sauce thickens, 8-10 minutes.</p>

            <li><h3>Step 4</h3></li>
            <p>Add cream and chopped cilantro. Simmer, stirring occasionally, until sauce thickens, 
            30-40 minutes.</p>

            <li><h3>Step 5</h3></li>
            <p>Meanwhile, preheat broiler. Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil and set a wire rack 
            inside sheet. Arrange chicken on rack in a single layer. Broil until chicken starts to 
            blacken in spots (it will not be cooked through), about 10 minutes.</p>

            <li><h3>Step 6</h3></li>
            <p>Cut chicken into bite-size pieces, add to sauce, and simmer, stirring occasionally,
            until chicken is cooked through, 8-10 minutes. Serve with rice and cilantro sprigs</p>
