    <p><h2><strong>Description</strong></h2></p>
    <p>Indian cuisine is definitely my weakness. Saying no to an Indian dish is just not something
        that I am capable of. This Chicken Tikka Masala recipe is sure to impress if you're cooking 
        for a crowd, and will offer a meal you'll come back to time and time again, even if you're 
        just cooking for yourself

    <p><h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p><ul>
            <p><h4><strong>6 Servings</strong></h4></p>
            <li>6 cloves garlic, finely grated</li>
            <li>4 tsp. finely grated peeled ginger</li>
            <li>4 tsp. ground turmeric</li>
            <li>2 tsp. garam masala</li>
            <li>2 tsp. ground coriander</li>
            <li>2 tsp. ground cumin</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups whole-milk yogurt (not Greek)</li>
            <li></li>
        </ul></p>
    
    <p><h2>Instructions</h2></p>
        <p><ol>
            <li><h3>Step 1</h3></li>
            <p>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.
            Add fettuccini and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.</p>
            
            <li><h3>Step 2</h3></li>
            <p>In a large saucepan, melt butter into cream over low heat.
            Add salt, pepper and garlic. Stir in cheese over medium heat 
            until melted; this will thicken the sauce.</p>
            
            <li><h3>Step 3</h3></li>
            <p>Add pasta to sauce. Use enough of the pasta so that all of 
            the sauce is used and the pasta is thoroughly coated. Serve immediately.</p>
